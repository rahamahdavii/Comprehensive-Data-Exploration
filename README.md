# comprehensive-Data-Exploration
Understand the problem: We'll look at each variable and do a philosophical analysis about their meaning and importance for this problem.
Univariable study: We'll just focus on the dependent variable ('SalePrice') and try to know a little bit more about it.
Multivariate study: We'll try to understand how the dependent variable and independent variables relate.
Basic cleaning: We'll clean the dataset and handle the missing data, outliers and categorical variables.
Test assumptions: We'll check if our data meets the assumptions required by most multivariate techniques.
